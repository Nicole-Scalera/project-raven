Answers from Aiden about: Notes on Maps & Clues – 10/15/25 | Attendees: Nikki, Ferris, Dan
Parking Lot:
Need a sketch and clear indicators of how it connects to the factory
Ex. the parking lot is technically a physically separate location/scene from the Factory itself
At what point of the map do we switch to the Factory?
- Front door of Factory
- Needs to interact with the door to enter
Do we have barricades that encapsulate the lot itself to keep the player from escaping?
- The parking lot is surrounded by a high fence with barbed wire, and a large gate has closed behind the player to prevent them from leaving
Suggestion from Dan:
Should there be a car model in the lot that the player spawns at? And if so, how many?
- We don’t need other cars in the lot really, because it ties into the theme of being the only person working there
- At least one car for the player
- Maybe a few branded company vehicles (can use the one we already made just slightly modified)
What distinct features are in the lot (trash, weeds poking out of asphalt, a gravel/stone pathway) that would be relevant to the artists?
- Details are in the Deliverables Google Doc for the parking lot. Colin is also working on a detailed description list for all art assests
- Might need to make an empty shell of the factory in this scene to make it clear that the player is entering the location
- Factory should be scaled up to make it look HUGE from the outside
