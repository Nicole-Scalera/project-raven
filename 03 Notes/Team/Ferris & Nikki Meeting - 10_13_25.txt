Ferris & Nikki Meeting - 10/13/25

- Ferris is going to talk with the writing team about clues.
- In terms of saving, Nikki should still work on the save system for carrying clues between scenes.
- Once the writers are done with the clue list, there will be a set of different clues for different days.
- Each day, there should be a way to check if the Player found a clue.
	- If yes:
		- Check it off somehow
		- Ensure it appears back on the board in the apartment.
- The only thing finding clues might impact is the dialogue, but it's fine for now.
- If all of the clues are gathered, it MAY change the ending.
	- Touch base on this later.
- A little notification of a clue being found via a HUD might help.
- The factory will be different pieces which is important for hit boxes, walls, and textures.
- Dan may help Ferris add everything in correctly.
