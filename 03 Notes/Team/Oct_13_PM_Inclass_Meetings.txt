Oct 13 | In class meetings
Attendees: Tori, France, Sami
- Need to figure out how to import the interaction animation (ex. Furnace doors open on command) rather than just a continuous animation (ex. Conveyor belt)
- Color palette: Dark, muted, (brown/grey/green), think Fear to Fathom
- Sami said done w apartment by Oct 15 (will have a clue board template for clue implementation later on)
- Maybe a wireframe/storyboard for interactions?

Attendees: Ferris
- Factory layout sometime next week (hopefully Oct 22 latest)
- Has color coded assets (walls are red, floors are green, etc) for organizational clarity 
- Each section of the factory is now modular and separated to make collision/hitbox setup and later adjustments easier
- Also working on clues and will sync with Writers to make sure clues align with story progression

Attendees: Colin
- Creating a comprehensive art description list covering props, walls, floors, ceilings, environments, and interactive items for the artists
- Will also contribute to the clue system, helping define visual cues and narrative consistency

Attendees: Aidan
- Rough outline/script for programmers
  - Includes when/what triggers a scene switch
